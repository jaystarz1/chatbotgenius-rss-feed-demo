 AI NEWS FEED DEMO - TEST INSTRUCTIONS
=========================================

Hi Rapidfire Web team!

This is a live working demo of the automated RSS news aggregation system.

=========================================
 QUICK TEST (2 MINUTES)
=========================================

Option 1: View the Live Demo Page
----------------------------------
Just open this URL in your browser:
https://jaystarz1.github.io/chatbotgenius-rss-feed-demo/test-page.html

You should see:
✓ AI news articles loading
✓ Category filter buttons at top
✓ Click filters to see articles by category
✓ All articles link to their sources

Option 2: Test in Webflow (5 MINUTES)
--------------------------------------
1. Open Webflow Designer
2. Create a test page (or use existing)
3. Drag an "Embed" element to the page
4. Open the file: WEBFLOW-CODE.html (in this folder)
5. Copy ALL the code
6. Paste into the Embed element
7. Publish the page
8. Visit your published page

You should see the same AI news loading on your Webflow page!

=========================================
 WHAT YOU'RE SEEING
=========================================

This demo is pulling live AI news from 17 different sources:
- Google Alert RSS feeds for AI-related topics
- Updates automatically every 3 hours
- Categorizes articles into 17 topics
- Shows the 100 most recent articles

Categories include:
- Business, Tech, Jobs, HR
- Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, NVIDIA
- ML, Ethics, Privacy, Security
- Healthcare, Education, Legal
- And more...

=========================================
 HOW IT WORKS (BEHIND THE SCENES)
=========================================

1. GitHub Actions runs every 3 hours
2. Fetches articles from 17 RSS feeds
3. Parses and categorizes each article
4. Saves to a JSON file
5. Your website loads that JSON file
6. JavaScript displays the articles

All running on FREE infrastructure:
- GitHub Actions (free tier)
- GitHub Pages (free hosting)
- No servers needed!

=========================================
 THE DATA SOURCE
=========================================

The news data comes from this URL:
https://jaystarz1.github.io/chatbotgenius-rss-feed-demo/data/news.json

You can open that URL in your browser to see the raw data.
It's just JSON - any website can load it!

=========================================
 FOR YOUR CLIENTS
=========================================

Each client would get:
1. Their own GitHub repo (like this demo)
2. RSS feeds for THEIR industry (not AI)
3. Categories customized for THEIR topics
4. Updates automatically every 3 hours
5. Simple Webflow integration (copy/paste)

Examples:
- Real estate agency → housing news

1. We can discuss how to offer this to your clients
2. Options:
   - I set up each client ($250-300 per setup)
   - I train your team to do it
   - Hybrid approach

3. Each client setup includes:
   - Research their industry topics
   - Create Google Alerts (RSS feeds)
   - Set up GitHub repository
   - Test the workflow
   - Provide Webflow integration code
   - Documentation

=========================================
 TECHNICAL NOTE
=========================================

This is a PUBLIC GitHub repository (required for free GitHub Pages).
The code is visible, but it's just RSS aggregation logic.

For production clients, each gets their own public repo.
This is standard for GitHub Pages sites - not a security concern.

=========================================

Thanks for checking out the demo!
